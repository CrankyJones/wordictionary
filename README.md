## Technologies Used

* Ruby
* Sinatra
* RSPEC
* Pry

## Description

The home page will allow the user to add additional words to the list or click on a word to see any added definitions. Adding a new word takes the user to a new page with a text field and submit button. Clicking on an existing entry takes the used to a page for that word. Useres can edit the current word, delete the word, click on an existing definition, or add a new definition to the word. If a user clicks an existing definition, the user can then edit or delete the definition. Editing the word or adding a definition can be done from the same page and should see the additions/changes immediately. Each page except the home page has a link at the bottom to navigate back to the main page.
